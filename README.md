# Predicting Recruitment Rates in Clinical Trials

### Overview
This project aims to predict the **Study Recruitment Rate (RR)** for clinical trials, a critical metric in the drug development process. By leveraging advanced machine learning models and domain-specific language representations, the solution enhances the prediction process, enabling efficient clinical trial planning and management.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned textual columns for alphanumeric values.
   - Transformed categorical features using one-hot encoding.
   - Standardized numerical columns with `StandardScaler`.
   - Handled missing values through selective imputation or feature elimination.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Integrated numerical features with textual embeddings extracted via **BioBERT**.
   - Modeled temporal features such as trial duration and completion dates.

3. **Modeling**:
   - Implemented a **Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBM)** for prediction.
   - Fine-tuned hyperparameters using **Bayesian Optimization**.
   - Benchmarked results with alternative models like **LightGBM**.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): 0.34
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.083
   - RÂ² Score: 0.45
